# Emotes

Once this was supposed to be a replacement for great ".e 17 freeze 1 255 255 1" that gave us godmode in Sw1ft's server.
Even though it turned the game into mess, it still was fun.
But some explorations through server code led me to some interesting results: thus making an advanced version of wootguy's emotes plugin.
