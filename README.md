# Emotes

Once this was supposed to be a replacement for great ".e 17 freeze 1 255 255 1" that gave us godmode in Sw1ft's server.
Even though it turned the game into a mess, it still was fun.
But some explorations through server code lead me to some interesting results: thus making an advanced version of wootguy's emotes plugin.

# models/player.mdl
Replace this file in your server installation if you want to make work sequences beyond 190 work (on weeb models usually)
